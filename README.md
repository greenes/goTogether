# goTogether

goTogether is an application that helps groups plan and organize vacations together.
I always find planning trips with groups of friends difficult because people will say they are interested but no
one will really take the lead in planning. The leader has to visit many different sites and do a lot of research. This will allow everyone to share some of the responsibility of planning and keep everyone up-to-date on the details of the trip.

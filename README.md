# goTogether

goTogether is an application that helps groups plan and organize vacations together.
I always find planning trips with groups of friends difficult because people will say they are interested
Users will be able to login an see a common page for their vacation and edit it.
Users can search for accomodations and add them as potential places for the group to stay.
Users can search yelp in the potential area and add restaurants/activities to the itinerary.
